## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Flutter & Dart** for cross-platform UI
- **Spotify Web API** for playlist and track data
- **OAuth 2.0** for Spotify login
- **Gemini API** for genre and mood analysis


## ⚠️ Important Limitation

- Due to recent changes in Spotify’s developer policy (effective May 15, 2025), all new apps that use Spotify services (like PlayFlash) are restricted to **Development Mode** by default.

## ❔ Why This Limitation Exists

- Spotify now grants Extended Quota Mode only to established organizations (those with 250k+ monthly active users), and not to individual developers like me :(

- Since PlayFlash is a personal project developed by a solo undergrad and not affiliated with any registered business entity, it does not currently meet Spotify’s criteria for extended quota access.

## 🚧 What This Means for You

- PlayFlash can currently be used by up to 25 users, whose Spotify emails I must manually add via the Spotify Developer Dashboard.

- This is **not** a bug or limitation of PlayFlash — it is a platform restriction imposed by Spotify from May 15, 2025.

- Once your Spotify account is added, PlayFlash will work as intended — fetching playlists and generating mood-based collections.
